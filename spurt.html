      <h3>Spurt Group</h3>

      <p>
        Steering the ship as Development Lead for Spurt was an exhilarating
        experience. In this pivotal role, I had the privilege of guiding a
        dynamic team of developers in crafting a multifaceted platform that
        encompassed Spurt Group's diverse services.
        <br />
        <br />
        At Spurt Group, we envisioned a comprehensive platform that seamlessly
        integrated various facets, each representing a fully independent and
        robust application in its own right. This ambitious undertaking included
        the development of a job board and careers page, a product display page,
        contract and onboarding forms, user authentication, a news and
        publication hub, an admin dashboard, an invoicing system, and even a
        chat feature. The aim was to provide Spurt Group's clientele with an
        all-encompassing digital experience.
        <br />
        <br />
        My role was akin to being the conductor of a symphony, harmonizing the
        efforts of a talented team of developers to ensure that each facet of
        this multifaceted platform not only met but exceeded industry standards.
        It was about more than just coding; it was about crafting a
        user-centric, smooth, and intuitive User Interface that seamlessly
        navigated through the diverse services offered.
        <br />
        <br />
        Technologically, we harnessed the power of React, Next.js, Node.js and
        AWS to bring this ambitious vision to life. This platform became a
        testament to our dedication to innovation, collaboration, and the
        pursuit of excellence.
        <br />
        <br />
        As the Development Lead at Spurt Group, I had the privilege of not only
        shaping the digital landscape but also of leading a team that thrived on
        the challenges of building something truly groundbreaking. It was an
        exciting chapter in my career, one that showcased the transformative
        potential of technology when creativity and expertise converge. ðŸš€ðŸ’»ðŸŒŸ
