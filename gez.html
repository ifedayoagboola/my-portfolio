      <h3>Green Economic Zone</h3>

      <p>
        My role as the solo developer on the Green Economic Zone (GEZ) project
        was an exhilarating journey into the world of web development. Tasked
        with the challenge of converting a WordPress-based website into a
        meticulously crafted, hard-coded multi-page platform, I set out to
        create an online experience that would not only be visually striking but
        also highly user-friendly.
        <br />
        <br />
        One of the project's standout features was its heavy reliance on images.
        Optimizing the display of these images while maintaining exceptional UI
        and UX was a paramount objective. I understood that the visual appeal
        and performance of the website were critical in conveying the essence of
        the Green Economic Zone.
        <br />
        <br />
        To achieve this, I harnessed the power of React, a versatile JavaScript
        library known for its flexibility and performance capabilities. Pairing
        React with the streamlined styling of Tailwind CSS, I was able to
        breathe new life into the website's design. The result was not just a
        transformation; it was a metamorphosis.
        <br />
        <br />
        My role extended beyond coding; it encompassed problem-solving,
        creativity, and an unwavering commitment to delivering a polished,
        image-rich website that exceeded expectations. The GEZ project was a
        testament to the power of a solo developer's vision and technical
        prowess, transforming a WordPress site into a finely tuned, visually
        captivating online presence. üåøüíºüåê
